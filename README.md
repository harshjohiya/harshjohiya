## 💡 About Me

I am a second-year BS Engineering student at IISER Bhopal, passionate about leveraging data and machine learning to solve real-world problems.
I design intelligent systems, analyze complex datasets, and transform raw data into actionable insights that drive decisions.

> *"I believe in learning by doing—if an idea comes to mind, I prototype it, test it, and refine it until it works."*

## 💡 About Me

I'm passionate about leveraging **data** and **machine learning** to solve real-world problems. I design intelligent systems, analyze complex datasets, and transform raw data into actionable insights that drive decisions.

> *"I believe in learning by doing—if an idea comes to mind, I prototype it, test it, and refine it until it works."*
